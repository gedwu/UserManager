## Few simple requirements

- Design must be responsive. Because we live in our smartphones and we will check with them for sure.
- Use popular PHP framework (Laravel, Lumen, Symfony, Zend or any other)
- Use VueJS, AngularJS or ReactJS.
- Use CSS preprocessor (SCSS preferred).
- Browser support must be great. All modern browsers plus IE9 and above.
- Use a Javascript task-runner. Webpack, Grunt or Gulp - it doesn't matter.
- Do not commit the build, because we are building things on deployment.

## Few tips

- Structure! WE LOVE STRUCTURE!
